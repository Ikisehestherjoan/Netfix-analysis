## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is a collection of Netflix-related data, including information about movies, TV shows, user reviews, and viewing statistics. This dataset was obtained from KAGGLE

- Data Integration: Merged relevant data from different sources to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- Data Transformation: Formatted data, created new variables, and standardized data types.
- Data Exploration: Visualized basic statistics to understand the distribution of key variables.

The code for data preparation can be found in the `NETFLIX.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
